# üéØ Problem 39: Joining Strings 
> **A program to join elements of a `vector` or an array into a single string with a specified delimiter.**

---

## üìò Project Overview
This program demonstrates two approaches to join elements of a collection (`vector` or array) into a single concatenated string using a delimiter.

---

## üåü Features
1. **Join Strings in a `vector`**: Combines all elements of a `vector<string>` into a single string separated by a specified delimiter.
2. **Join Strings in an Array**: Performs the same operation for a string array with a given length.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### 1. Functions
- **`Join_String(vector<string> vString, string Delimiter)`**:
  - Iterates through the elements of the vector.
  - Concatenates each element with the specified delimiter.
  - Removes the trailing delimiter before returning the result.

- **`Join_String(string aString[], short length, string Delimiter)`**:
  - Similar to the vector version but works with arrays of strings and a given length.

### 2. Program Execution
1. Defines a `vector<string>` and an array of strings with sample data.
2. Joins the elements of the `vector` using the first function.
3. Joins the elements of the array using the second function.
4. Displays the concatenated results.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Sample Execution
Example output:

```plaintext
Vector After Join : 
Abderrazzak + Hassania + Mohammed + Taha

Array After Join : 
Abdo && Hassania && Med && Toto
