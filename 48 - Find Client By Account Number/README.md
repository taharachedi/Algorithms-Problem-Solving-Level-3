1. **File Handling**:
   - Reads client data from a text file (`Clients.txt`) with each record formatted as:  
     `Account_Number#//#PIN_Code#//#Name#//#Phone#//#Account_Balance`.

2. **Search Functionality**:
   - Users can search for a client by entering their account number.

3. **Data Parsing**:
   - Each record from the file is split and stored in a structured format (`stClient`).

4. **Client Data Display**:
   - Neatly displays client details such as account number, PIN code, name, phone number, and account balance.
