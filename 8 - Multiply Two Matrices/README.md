# üü© Problem 8: Matrix Multiplication Program 

> **A C++ program to generate two random 3x3 matrices, display them, and output their product matrix.**

## üìò Project Overview
This program demonstrates matrix manipulation by generating two random 3x3 matrices, displaying them, and calculating their product. The output shows the original matrices followed by their multiplication result.

---

## üåü Features
- **Random Matrix Generation**: Creates two 3x3 matrices with random values.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Computes the product of the two matrices.
- **Formatted Output**: Uses `printf` to display matrices in a clean, formatted grid.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Core Functions
1. **`Fill_Random_Matrix(short arr[3][3], short Rows, short Cols)`**
   - Fills the matrix with random numbers in a specified range.

2. **`Print_Matrix(short arr[3][3], short Rows, short Cols)`**
   - Outputs the matrix in a 3x3 grid format, aligning values for readability.

3. **`Multiply_Two_Matrix(short arr1[3][3], short arr2[3][3], short Mult[3][3], short Rows, short Cols)`**
   - Computes the matrix product by performing the dot product of rows from the first matrix with columns of the second matrix.

### Program Flow
1. **Generate and Display Two Matrices**: Initializes and displays two 3x3 matrices with random values.
2. **Compute and Display Product**: Multiplies the matrices and outputs the resulting matrix.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Sample Output
A sample run of the program might look like this:

```plaintext
Matrix1:
  4   2   7 
  5   9   1 
  3   6   8 

Matrix2:
  1   5   2 
  9   4   3 
  7   3   6 

Result:
 75  47  55 
107  62  62 
103  59  63
